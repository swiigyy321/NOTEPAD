1. Initial Setup & Security
First-Time Use: When you launch the app for the first time, you will be prompted to Create a Password.

Registration: Once entered, the system saves your credentials to a secure file and automatically closes. Restart the program to begin using the notepad.

Logging In: Enter your saved password. You have 3 attempts to log in correctly. For your protection the app will lock and exit after three failed tries.

2. Managing Your Notes
The application uses a simple menu driven system to handle your data:

Create (Option 1): Add a new entry by entering the Date (e.g. 19-12-2025) followed by your Content. The message "SAVED!" confirms the note is permanently stored.

View History (Option 2): Display list of all saved entries.

Delete (Option 3): Remove an entry by typing its exact date. The system will scan your records and erase that specific note instantly.

Edit (Option 4): Update an existing note by entering its date. The app displays the old text and prompts you for a new date and new content to replace it.

3. Exiting the Program
Option 5: Always use this option to exit.
